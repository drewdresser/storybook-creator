Ella popped on her polka-dot sun hat. The garden was full of sunny flowers! Woof! Her little black-and-white puppy, Rory, wagged his tail all around her feet. It was a happy day to play outside.

Look, Ella! Colorful pinwheels stood tall by the daisies. A tiny breeze tickled Ellaâ€™s nose and *whoosh*! The pinwheels started to spin. Spin, spin, spin! Round and round went the bright colors. Ella giggled with delight.

Rory saw the spinning! He barked a happy "Woof!" and sniffed one of the pinwheels gently. It stopped spinning for a second, then the wind made it go again! Spin, spin! Ella clapped her hands, "Silly puppy!"

Peeking from behind a big red flower, Ella saw something new. It was a mini rocket ship! Made just from a cardboard box, but it looked ready to fly. It pointed right up to the blue sky.

Ella crawled over to the little rocket ship. She patted its side. "Whoosh!" she whispered, pretending it was blasting off. Up, up, up! Rory sniffed the cardboard rocket, wagging his tail. Maybe he wanted to go to the moon too!

Ella gave Rory a big, soft hug. The sun was warm, the flowers smelled sweet, the pinwheels kept spinning, and her rocket was ready for adventure. What a wonderful, busy day in the blooming backyard garden!
