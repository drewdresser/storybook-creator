Ella giggled in the sunny garden. Her polka-dot sun hat bobbed as she patted the soft green grass. Woof! Rory, her fluffy puppy, wagged his tail, sniff-sniff-sniffing a big yellow flower. The garden was full of bright colors!

Bzzzzzt! A little bumblebee with tiny wings landed gently on a pink petal. "Bee!" Ella pointed with her little finger. Rory wagged his tail even faster. This was Bitsy the bee, and she loved finding new things.

Bitsy buzzed near a colorful pinwheel. "Whee!" buzzed Bitsy. Ella leaned close and blew a tiny puff of air. Whoosh! The pinwheel spun round and round! Red, blue, yellow, spin, spin, spin! Ella clapped her hands.

Next, they saw a mini rocket ship made of cardboard. "Up, up, up!" buzzed Bitsy, flying high above the rocket. Ella patted the side of the ship. Rory gave it a curious sniff. Maybe one day it would zoom to the sky!

Bitsy led them to a shiny circle near some leaves â€“ a tiny ladybug laboratory! "Look!" buzzed Bitsy. A little red ladybug with black spots crawled slowly. Ella peered close, her eyes wide. "Wow! Tiny bug!" she whispered.

The sun felt warm. Ella yawned a big yawn. Rory curled up on the grass. Bitsy buzzed a soft goodbye near the flowers. What a fun day discovering things in the garden! Time for sleepy snuggles.
